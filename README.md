# Hi!
## About me:
You can call me Hieliksuslik or just Hielik, or Hiel, whichever you fancy.  
I enjoy meeting new people!

### I am currently:
- Learning C# (and the infinite pit of things to do)
- Interning
- Finishing up college
- Still procrastinating
- Getting a handle on Consulting/Learning the trade

### Planning on:
- Learning enough basics to make a general blog
- Make a roguelike/roguelite
- Cleaning up Capstone project/re-making in C#
